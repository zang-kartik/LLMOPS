# **LLMOPS**

Large Language Model Ops (LLMOps) encompasses the practices, techniques and tools used for the operational management of large language models in production environments. The advancement in LLM underscored by releases such as chatGPT, Bard etc. are driving significant growth in enterprises building and deploying LLMs. This significant growth has led to the need to build best practices to how to operationalize these models. LLMOps allows for efficient deployment, monitoring and maintainance of large language models. 

## **Components of LLMOps**

The span of LLMOps in machine learning project can as focused or expansive as the project demands, In certain cases llmops can encompass everything from data preparation to pipeline production, while other projects may require implementation of only the model deployment process. Majority of enterprises deploy LLMOps principle across the following:

- **EDA**
- **Data preparation and Prompt Engineering**
- **Model Fine Tuning**
- **Model review and governance**
- **Model inference and serving**
- **Model monitoring and human feedback**
