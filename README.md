# **LLMOPS**

Large Language Model Ops (LLMOps) encompasses the practices, techniques and tools used for the operational management of large language models in production environments. The advancement in LLM underscored by releases such as chatGPT, Bard etc. are driving significant growth in enterprises building and deploying LLMs. This significant growth has led to the need to build best practices to how to operationalize these models. LLMOps allows for efficient deployment, monitoring and maintainance of large language models. 

## **Components of LLMOps**

The span of LLMOps in machine learning project can as focused or expansive as the project demands, In certain cases llmops can encompass everything from data preparation to pipeline production, while other projects may require implementation of only the model deployment process. Majority of enterprises deploy LLMOps principle across the following:

- **EDA**
- **Data preparation and Prompt Engineering**
- **Model Fine Tuning**
- **Model review and governance**
- **Model inference and serving**
- **Model monitoring and human feedback**

**LLMOps platform** -> An LLMOps platform basically provides data scientist and software engineer with a collabrative environment that facilitates iterative data exploration, real time coworking capabilities for experiment tracking, prompt engineering, and model and pipeline management, as well as controlled model transitioning, deployment, and monitoring for LLMs. LLMOps automates the operational, synchronization and monitoring aspects of the machine learning lifecycle.


**LLMOps solutions can be evalutated under 3 main categories**

- **LLMOps platforms** -> These platforms are specifically designed for LLMOps or this are the MLOps platforms which started offering LLMOps capabilities. They include features that allows carrying out these operations on LLMs:
  - Finetuning
  - Versioning
  - Deploying

- **Integration Platforms** -> This tools facilitates building LLM applications, such as chatbots, document generator etc.

- **Vector databases** -> Vector database stores high dimensional data vectors, such as blood reports, general health etc.

Beside this there many other tools which streamlines the specific part of LLM workflow such as testing prompts, incorporating human feedback or evaluating datasets.


## **Comparison of top LLMOps platforms**

LLMOps platform can examined in these categories

- **MLOps platforms** -> Some MLOps platforms can be deployed for LLMOps, MLOps manages and optimizes the end to end ML lifecycle. Since LLMOps are also machine learning model MLOps vendors are naturally expanding in this field.

- **LLM platforms** -> Some LLM platforms such as OpenAI, are also providing LLMOps capabilities to fine tune, integrate and deploy LLM models.

- **Data platforms** -> Cloud platforms example google, amazon and azure have also launched their LLMOps offering which allows user to deploy their models from different providers with ease.

- **LLMOps platforms** -> This platforms extensively focuses on optimizing and managing LLM operations.

## **Some top LLMOps tools are**

- **Comet** -> Comet streamlines the ML lifecycle, tracking experiments and production models, it also provides various deployment strategies.

- **Deep lake** -> Deep lake combines capabilities of Data lakes and vector databases to create, refine and implement high quality LLMs as well as MLOps solutions for businesses.

- **Fine tuner AI** -> Fine tuner AI is a no code platform, which can connected via third party tools and rest API.

- **Lamini AI** -> Lamini AI provides an easy method for training LLMs through both prompt-tuning and base model training. Users can integrate their own data, and host resulting LLM on their infrastructure.

- **Snorkel AI** -> Snorkel AI empowers enterprises to construct or customize foundational model and LLMs to acheive remarkable precision on domain specific datasets and use cases.

- **Titan ML** -> Titan ML is an NLP development platform that aims businesses to build and implement smaller more economical deployment of LLMs.

- **Valohai** -> Valohai streamlines MLOps and LLMOps automating data extraction to model deployment.

- **ZenML** -> ZenML platform primarily focuses on operations of machine learning life cycle.
